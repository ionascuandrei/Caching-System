# Caching System
Implements a caching system for text files with 3 different input policy updates: First in First Out, Least Recently Used and Time Aware Least Recently Used, with the required operations: hit, miss, put. In the implementation I used Adapter, Strategy and Observer patterns.
Personal gains:
-	understanding the concepts of Desing Patterns: Adapter, Strategy and Observer
-	understanding a practical and essential system in computer architecture
-	using data structures in OOP context

Programming language/libraries/tools used: Java, Desing Patterns
